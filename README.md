One way of keeping track of the relative polarization in Congress is the DW-Nominate score, which is computed based on how Congressmen voted. It is a relative scale and can be plotted in 2 dimensions.

This repository serves as a wrapper to an ftp server (k7moa). Just in case it goes down at some point, the relevant data file is included, along with a function to get the information from the ftp file if needed.

As you can probably quickly notice, polarization is up in recent Congresses. [More info about this can be found here.](https://legacy.voteview.com/dwnomin_joint_house_and_senate.htm)
